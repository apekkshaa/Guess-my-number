# Guess-my-number

The goal of this project is to simply guess a number which is between 1 and 20. <br>
Upon entering the number you are given a hint whether you are close to the number or not.

Let's say 15, then you click Check!<br>
And then on the right side you get a message. In this case it says, that your guess was Too high!

Also you can see that you started with a Score of 20 and now after one failed guess it decreased to 19.
So basically after each guess that you fail, the score decreases by one.

Let's try 5, now it's too low. So we get a different message.

when you get the number correct this "Correct number!" message is displayed and screen turns green
and also you now have the Highscore of 16.

Highscore is another feature of this small application, if you're quicker in the next round,
your Highscore will then become better.<br>

If you want to play again, you can simply click the Again! button and it all resets everything except for the Highscore.
